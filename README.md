Roguelike game and probably tiniest roguelike library for [Arduboy](https://arduboy.com/) or [its emulator](https://github.com/felipemanga/ProjectABE/releases/latest) influenced by NetHack and WildTangent's FATE.

## Bottom panel:
* memory left in bytes `556` (if `LOW` then you better start destroying most useless objects)
* current year `14Y`
* current day `1D`
* current hour `1:`
* current minute `:1`
* current negative elevation `0`

## Controls:
* <kbd>Up</kbd> , <kbd>Down</kbd> , <kbd>Left</kbd> , <kbd>Right</kbd> - move cursor
* <kbd>A</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Up</kbd> , <kbd>Down</kbd> , <kbd>Left</kbd> , <kbd>Right</kbd> - move player
* <kbd>A</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> - select object for action or give object to the next potential owner in your possessions
* <kbd>B</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd> - toggle menu at cursor position or cancel action
* to take something 'on this use player'
* to drop something 'on floor `.` use this'

## Game features:
* bot
* cursor
* pet
* toilet
* thirst
* real-world logic
* communist economy
* no stupid HP, MP, EXP, SP, LVL or other lazy math abstractions of reality complexity
* priority of things relations over the soulless loot
* simplicity in randomness, no need to know game formulas and equations
* YASD is hard to do (except with destroy feature)

## Programming features for using as library for other Arduboy roguelikes:
* pathfinding algorithm for generating caves
* scene builder
* object builder
* dynamic memory allocation for every object (yes, you can run out of memory)
* full power of parametric polymorphism
* master OOP pattern at the core - prototype (exemplar)
* easy scripting for objects interactions

## How to build:

## Roguelike library documentation:
Library uses dynamic memory allocation and parametric polymorphism principles. There is no memory for smart pointers implementation so don't forget to `delete` objects when you don't need them anymore like this:
```
Class *c = Class::exemplar.make(object_template);
delete c;
c = 0;
```
### Class
Base class and interface for all objects. Is must be used everywhere. Inherit all your new classes from Class.
#### Class::exemplar
Object maker instance with Print custom tiles functionality.
```
virtual Class *make(const char* s); //always create all your objects with this method. DONT FORGET TO destroy THEM AFTER! First char is the object type.
static int hasMoreMemory() { //returns free memory size or 0 if the size is under 300
static void printDebug(char* c); //use this for debuging purposes with itoa
static void setCursor(int8_t x, int8_t y); //Arduboy2 library analog with custom tiles
static void setTextColor(const uint8_t color); //Arduboy2 library analog with custom tiles
static void setTextBackground(const uint8_t color); //Arduboy2 library analog with custom tiles
```
#### Class::arduboy
#### Class::sprites
### Scene
Map on the screen. Dynamically allocated array of pointers to Class.
#### Class *Scene::atPut(Directive key, Class *arg)

```
switch (key) {
case Class::Directive::Greater: //atPut clone arg and set clone to be min path in autogenerated scene 
case Class::Directive::Less: //atPut clone arg and set clone to be max path in autogenerated scene
case Class::Directive::Cursor: //atPut set cursor on owner of arg or return NULL
case Class::Directive::Near: //atPut check arg is near the cursor and return arg if true. if false then return class under cursor
case Class::Directive::Owner: //atPut get owner of arg in the scene if it exists or return NULL
case Class::Directive::Delete: //atPut delete arg from every other class on the scene if arg is not scene block
case Class::Directive::Move: //atPut move arg by shortest path
case Class::Directive::Turn: //atPut set next turn to all classes in the scene
case Class::Directive::Search: //atPut find next position of arg copy in the scene
case Class::Directive::Next: //atPut clear the scene except arg and his classes
case Class::Directive::Far: //atPut place arg on scene to be farest by path
case Class::Directive::Close: //atPut place arg to be closest by path but may block the only path through
case Class::Directive::Clear: //atPut clear all clones of arg in the scene
case Class::Directive::Path: //atPut clone arg and set clone to be path prototype for the scene
case Class::Directive::Block: //atPut clone arg and set clone to be block prototype for the scene
case Class::Directive::Map: //atPut set path coordinates leading to arg
case Class::Directive::Build: //atPut try to build the scene and bounds with x and y sizes already setted then place arg there. If fail then return NULL
case Class::Directive::Character: //atPut place arg under a cursor
case Class::Directive::X: //atPut set x coordinate of a cursor within bounds if they exists. Set this to build initial scene
case Class::Directive::Y: //atPut set y coordinate of a cursor within bounds if they exists. Set this to build initial scene
case Class::Directive::Up: //atPut move arg. Return NULL if success, class that blocks way, arg if bounds
case Class::Directive::Down: //atPut move arg. Return NULL if success, class that blocks way, arg if bounds
case Class::Directive::Left: //atPut move arg. Return NULL if success, class that blocks way, arg if bounds
case Class::Directive::Right: //atPut move arg. Return NULL if success, class that blocks way, arg if bounds
case Class::Directive::Draw: //atPut draw scene on the screen for arg
}
```


#### Class *Scene::atGet(Directive key)
```
switch (key) {
case Class::Directive::Cursor: //atGet set cursor at start of scene
case Class::Directive::Delete: //atGet delete player under cursor from scene
case Class::Directive::Place: //atGet place scene block to be closest by path but without blocking other paths
case Class::Directive::Block: //atGet return block prototype of the scene
case Class::Directive::Close: //atGet place scene block to be closest by path but with blocking other paths
case Class::Directive::Turn: //atGet get next class who has turn
case Class::Directive::Character: //atGet get the class under the cursor
case Class::Directive::Up: //atGet move the cursor within bounds. Return NULL if bounds, or y path prototype if moved
case Class::Directive::Down: //atGet move the cursor within bounds. Return NULL if bounds, or y path prototype if moved
case Class::Directive::Left: //atGet move the cursor within bounds. Return NULL if bounds, or y path prototype if moved
case Class::Directive::Right: //atGet move the cursor within bounds. Return NULL if bounds, or y path prototype if moved
}
```
## How to add your classes:
Inherit from Class and implement interface:
```
virtual ~Class();
virtual Class *atPut(Directive key, Class *arg);
virtual Class *atGet(Directive key);
virtual Class *clone() const;
virtual Class *make(const char* s);
virtual char* toStr();
virtual int toInt();
virtual char getTypeChar();
```
Using existing macro:

`#define REGISTER_PROTOTYPE(CLASS) static CLASS CLASS##Instance = CLASS(Exemplar())`

register your subclass of Class before use:

`REGISTER_PROTOTYPE(YourSubClass);`
